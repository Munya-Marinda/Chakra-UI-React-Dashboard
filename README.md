# This is a Dashboard interface that I build using React.js and Chakra-UI.
> It functions as a portal for a business owner to view the amount of orders that they have and which need to be completed. I really-really learnt a lot during this project and went into depth with React, Typescript and dependencies/libraries.

Features:
  - Responsive to mobile and wideview. 
  - A Navigation Drawer
  - A piechart that shows Completed VS Incomplete orders from 'react-minimal-pie-chart'
  - A stats bar using 'chakra-ui' Stats component
  - A paginator that displays 6 oders per page on mobile view from 'chakra-paginator'
  - Shows each order in table-form using 'react-table' in wideview, and as small cards on mobileview.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started Today

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
